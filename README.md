# php_sample_codes
It consists of solution code in php for some sample exercises I have worked recently upon.

Problem 1:
We have a table called member which has 3 columns email, age_as_integer, gender - email is the primary key and age value is integer like 20, 30 , 40, 41, etc 
We want to find out in this table which age has the most number of members
so let's say we have 50 records with age 20, and 60 with age 21, and 55 with age 23 and so on you need to get the answer 21 given that is the age for most number of members.

Problem 2 : 
Write code to find elements in an array of integers that are not only duplicates but that are within 4 array index apart so in an example array of (1, 3, 4, 1, 2, 6, 1, 9, 8, 3)
we will get 1 as answer but not 3 because although 3 is duplicate the occurrence happens at more than 4 indices apart
